# Fraud Detection Portal - Progress Report

**Date**: [28/07/2025]  
**Phase**: Exploratory Data Analysis  
**Status**: In Progress  

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of current progress and key findings.

## Dataset Analysis Completed
### Data Quality
- ✅ No missing values detected
- ✅ Appropriate data types confirmed
- ✅ 284,807 total transactions loaded

### Class Distribution
- ✅ Extreme imbalance identified (0.17% fraud)
- ✅ Visualizations created with log scale
- ✅ Modeling strategy adjusted for imbalance

## Technical Environment
- ✅ Azure ML workspace configured
- ✅ Compute cluster (fraud-detection-cpu) operational
- ✅ Tabular dataset registered as "dataset2"

## Next Steps
1. Advanced EDA (correlation analysis, feature distributions)
2. Baseline LightGBM model training
3. Model evaluation with imbalance-aware metrics

## Key Decisions Made
- Dataset storage: Azure ML Tabular Dataset
- Development environment: Azure ML Studio Notebooks
- Visualization approach: Log scale for imbalanced classes

## Blockers/Risks
- None currently identified

## Resources Used
- Azure Student Credits: [Current usage]
- Compute hours: [Tracking needed]
